# Go and Work! (name TBD)

## What is it?

This will be a simple 'To Do' app with the intent of practicing Backend Development. \
The aim is to build a task app to promote productivity for individual use as well as group work (thus requiring good database structure).

The project also serves as a chance to try and build an application using Go lang which I am currently learning as part of the stack.

## Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS
- React
- JavaScript
- Go
- Gin
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku

## User Stories

As a user I would like to :

- be able to create an account to have my personal workspace
- be able to log in and out of the app 
- view tasks I have scheduled for 'today'
- view tasks scheduled for the 'week'
- view tasks scheduled for the 'month' (calendar format)
- view my task history to see how productive I am?
- mark tasks as complete 
- create tasks to keep track of my work with this app
- update tasks should they need changing
- delete tasks if they are no longer relevant

Stretch goals:

As a user I would like to :

- have the option to create a 'group' for tasks that require more than one person
- be able to assign tasks to individuals within the 'group'
- monitor use activity as admin of a group?
