# Go and Work! (name TBD)

## What is it?

This will be a simple 'To Do' app with the intent of practicing Backend Development. \
The aim is to build a task app to promote productivity for individual use as well as group work (thus requiring good database structure).

The project also serves as a chance to try and build an application using Go lang which I am currently learning as part of the stack.

## Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS
- React
- JavaScript
- Go
- Gin / Gonic ?
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku
